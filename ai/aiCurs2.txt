2 methods to solve any problem: 
	- a deterministic manner (knowing all the steps that you are going to take beforehand)
	- stochastic manner (solve real problems using artificial intelligence methods)
	
	
a problem definition involves a search space. this search space can be explicit or default (default actually defines the space mathematically)

example for solving by moving rules vs solving by search in the queen problem

by moving rules: adding a queen and checking the validity
by search: checking all queen layouts
