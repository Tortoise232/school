ADO.NET 

set of classes that enable .NET framework programmers to interact with a variety of data sources, e.g., databases (SQL Server, Oracle, ..., XML files, ...
-> .NET Framework Data provider for SQL Server - System.Data.SqlClient -> API prefix for Sql

download and install: sql server studio, and after making my first c# application, change it to use the .NET Framework provider for Oracle


SqlConnection
SqlCommand
SqlDataReader
SqlDataAdapter

code:
-----

SqlConnection con =  new SqlConnection("
			Data Source = RIVENDELL; Initial Catalog = Northwind; Integrated Security = true");
			YUser ID = sa; password = wp
			
con.Open();
con.Close();

SqlCommand command = new SqlCommand ("DELETE * FROM Pirates", con);
command.ExecuteNewCommand();
//command.ExecuteReader(); -> will return an object of type SqlDataReader
//a query that returns a value? -> command.ExecuteScalar()

SqlDataAdapter 
DataSet //it has a suggestive name

DataSet -> collection of (coll) Data Table
		-> coll Data Relation
		Data Table: coll DataColumn
					coll DataRow
					coll Constraint
					
SqlDataAdapters for any nr of tables we need
the SqlDataAdapter has all these command objects: Select Command Insert Command, Delete Command, Update Command\
To fill our DataSet, we use the fill method ( the connection has to be open beforehand)
the update method sedns all the local changes back to the database

Data Binding: open the form to our data set -> we will use a BindingSource that acts like a proxy between our data set and the grid
